## Features
- Easy to understand [documentation](Documentation.md)
- Simple and readable syntax
- Written in C++ for performance
- Designed for learning and experimentation

## Why Lotus?
We created Lotus to practice building a programming language and to explore how compilers and interpreters work. Our goal is to make a language that is both lightweight and beginner-friendly.

## Installation & Usage
(Currently, the project is in development. Installation instructions will be provided soon.)

## Example Code
Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Lotus:
```lotus
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Upcoming features
We are actively working on improving Lotus. Some planned features include:
- More standard libraries
- Bug fixes
- Unicode support
